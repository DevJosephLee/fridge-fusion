# FridgeFusion

## Description
A web application for food enthusiasts who want to search dish recipes. 

## Inspiration
My wife always struggles to find dish recipes with the available ingredients she has in the fridge. Husband to the rescue! FridgeFusion allows users to search dish recipes based on ingredients, dish name or even the dish type. In the near future, I plan on implementing vast range of features such as login, comment, rating, as well as allowing users to share their own recipes.

Happy wife, happy life...
